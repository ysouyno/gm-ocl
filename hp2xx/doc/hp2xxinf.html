<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC1">Introduction</A></H1>

<P>
The <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> program is a versatile tool to convert vector-oriented
graphics data given in Hewlett-Packard's HP-GL plotter language
into a variety of popular both vector- and raster-oriented graphics formats.

</P>
<P>
The various supported output formats include Encapsulated PostScript (EPS),
PCX, IMG, and several formats intended to facilitate the generation of
graphics within TeX documents.
In addition, <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> output is printable on the HP Laserjet/Deskjet
printer series, and it may be used as a HP-GL previewer on many
platforms, e.g. X11 and DOS (VGA).

</P>
<P>
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> first converts all HP-GL data into pure vectors and buffers
them internally. It then converts these vectors into a specified output
format (vector modes), or rasterizes them (raster modes) on an internal
bitmap. In raster modes, <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> then translates the bitmap into the
output format.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC2">Invoking <CODE>hp2xx</CODE></A></H2>

<P>
The format of the <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> command is:

</P>

<PRE>
hp2xx [<VAR>options</VAR>] [<VAR>input-file(s)</VAR>]
</PRE>

<P>
It follows the UNIX System V tradition of a filter, i. e., options begin
with <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, followed by a single letter and an optional parameter.
Options must appear immediately behind the program name and before the input
file name(s) (if specified). If no input file is given, <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> reads
from <CODE>stdin</CODE>. In addition to this traditional option handling,
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> also supports GNU-style long options and option/non-option
permutation (see section <A HREF="hp2xxinf.html#SEC30">Option summary</A>). However, throughout this manual
all examples will only display short options.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> writes to the output file whose name can be specified
by option <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>. Without option <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>, <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> generates
output file names from the input names and the selected mode
(see option <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>). <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> writes to <CODE>stdout</CODE> if you supply
a dash as output file name like in <SAMP>`-f-'</SAMP>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC3"><CODE>hp2xx</CODE> for the impatient</A></H2>

<P>
This section is intended to give those of you a quick-start who are
quite familiar with traditional UNIX-style programs and with HP-GL and
other graphics formats.
The following examples will give you a good idea of <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>'s
functionality. See section <A HREF="hp2xxinf.html#SEC30">Option summary</A> for further details.

</P>


<PRE>
hp2xx foo.hp
</PRE>

<P>
Preview of HP-GL graphics in file <TT>`foo.hp'</TT>. The picture will
fit into a square of 200 mm width, assuming that your output device
(screen) features 75 DPI resolution (default).

</P>

<PRE>
hp2xx -q -d86 -h160 -w220  foo.hp bar.hp
</PRE>

<P>
Multiple-file preview. Option <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> puts <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> into "quiet" mode.
The picture will fit into a rectangle of 220 mm width and 160 mm height,
assuming a 86 DPI resolution of the output device (screen).

</P>

<PRE>
hp2xx -t -c12340567 -p12230412 foo.hp
</PRE>

<P>
Preview, size according to original HP-GL data (as on a plotter),
with different pen colors and sizes. Color and width according to:

<PRE>
  <CODE>Pen # : Color code     / Size (pixel)</CODE>
  <CODE>-------------------------------------</CODE>
  <CODE>  1   : 1 (black)      /    1</CODE>
  <CODE>  2   : 2 (red)        /    2</CODE>
  <CODE>  3   : 3 (green)      /    2</CODE>
  <CODE>  4   : 4 (blue)       /    3</CODE>
  <CODE>  5   : 0 (background) /    0</CODE>
  <CODE>  6   : 5 (cyan)       /    4</CODE>
  <CODE>  7   : 6 (magenta)    /    1</CODE>
  <CODE>  8   : 7 (yellow)     /    2</CODE>
</PRE>


<PRE>
hp2xx -m eps -l a.log -h100 -w150 -p542  foo.hp bar.hp
</PRE>

<P>
Encapsulated Postscript mode. Files <TT>`foo.eps'</TT> and <TT>`bar.eps'</TT>
will be created. The diagnostic output will be written into <TT>`a.log'</TT>,
so <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> works quietly. Both EPS pictures will fit into a
rectangle of size 150 x 200 mm. The size (width) of
pen 1: 0.5 mm, pen 2: 0.4 mm, pen 3: 0.2 mm, pen 4 ... pen 8: 0.1 mm.

</P>

<PRE>
unix% cat foo.hp | hp2xx -m pcl -o30 -O50 -i -F -f- | lpr -P ljet
</PRE>

<P>
In this generic UNIX example, <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> reads HP-GL code from <CODE>stdin</CODE>,
converts it to HP-PCL which is suitable for direct output on any HP Laserjet
printer, and pipes the output via <CODE>stdout</CODE> into the appropriate printer queue.
Option <SAMP>`-f-'</SAMP> forces <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> to write to <CODE>stdout</CODE> instead of
a file, <SAMP>`-i'</SAMP> initializes the printer before the output,
<SAMP>`-F'</SAMP> sends a FormFeed at the end of output. There will be (additional)
30 mm left and 50 mm top margins. 75 DPI are assumed per default.

</P>

<PRE>
hp2xx -m pcx -f foo3.pcx -d300 -h80 -w150 -r90 -P2:4  foo.hp
</PRE>

<P>
PCX mode. Output goes into file <TT>`foo3.pcx'</TT>. A limiting rectangle
of 150 x 80 mm at 300 DPI is assumed. The picture will be rotated by
90 degrees. Only pages 2 to 4 of the multi-page HP-GL source is used (each
occurrence of HP-GL code <CODE>PG;</CODE> increments the internal page counter).

</P>



<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC4">Basics</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter provides you with almost anything you'll need for successful
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> applications. You'll probably soon operate <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>
by solely consulting the option summary (see section <A HREF="hp2xxinf.html#SEC30">Option summary</A>) or just
by calling <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> without any parameters to obtain its built-in
option summary.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC5">Modes of <CODE>hp2xx</CODE></A></H2>

<P>
The mode switch <SAMP>`-m <CODE>string</CODE>'</SAMP> tells <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> about the mode it
should use to generate output, i.e., the desired output format. <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>
can run in three different groups of modes: Generating vector graphics,
raster graphics, or "preview mode", i.e., displaying the graphics.
Preview is the default; see section <A HREF="hp2xxinf.html#SEC30">Option summary</A> for a list of all modes.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC6">Sizing your output</A></H2>

<P>
NOTE: The basic unit length within <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> is <CODE>mm</CODE> (millimeter).
This unit is always assumed except where noted otherwise.

</P>
<P>
In contrast to a real HP-GL plotter, <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> lets you decide freely
about the size of the picture. While preserving the picture's aspect ratio,
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> will fit the picture into a window of width <VAR>w</VAR> and
height <VAR>h</VAR>. By default, <VAR>w</VAR> = <VAR>h</VAR> = 200 (mm). Set these basic
sizes using options <SAMP>`-w <VAR>w</VAR>'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-h <VAR>h</VAR>'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Sometimes you'll want to change the aspect factor of a picture, e.g., to
spread out a square picture into landscape. Option <SAMP>`-a <VAR>af</VAR>'</SAMP> is used
for this. <VAR>af</VAR> &#62; 1 increases x/y ratio, 0 &#60; <VAR>af</VAR> &#60; 1 decreases x/y.

</P>
<P>
Example: Let's assume your picture covers a native coordinate range of
100...900 plotter units in x direction and 200...600 in y direction.
Thus, its width is double its height.
Using defaults, <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> will create a picture of size 200 x 100 mm,
while options <SAMP>`-w <VAR>100</VAR> -h <VAR>40</VAR>'</SAMP> will lead to a picture of
size 80 x 40 mm, and <SAMP>`-w <VAR>100</VAR> -h <VAR>40</VAR> -a <VAR>0.5</VAR>'</SAMP> results
in a 40 x 40 mm picture.

</P>
<P>
Alternatively, ignore explicit size control and rely on the true
HP-GL coordinates (and therefore: sizes) of the given input file(s).
Flag <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> inhibits <SAMP>`-a -h -w'</SAMP> and lets <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> use true
HP-GL sizes, based on the assumption that 1 HP unit = 1/40 mm.

</P>
<P>
Some modes of <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> support page offsets, i.e., left
and upper margins added to the picture, probably in addition to some
hard margins which cannot be avoided. Currently, these modes are
<VAR>eps</VAR>, <VAR>pcl</VAR>, and <VAR>pre</VAR>. The left margin (offset) is modified
with option <SAMP>`-o <VAR>off_left</VAR>'</SAMP>, while the upper margin can be
controlled via <SAMP>`-O <VAR>off_upper</VAR>'</SAMP>. <VAR>off_left</VAR> and <VAR>off_upper</VAR>
are specified in mm.

</P>
<P>
Option <SAMP>`-C'</SAMP> (center the picture) works in combination with options
<SAMP>`-o -O'</SAMP> by modifying the offsets in such a way that the resulting
picture is centered within the frame defined by options <SAMP>`-w -h'</SAMP>. Example:
Assume that the picture is a square, and <SAMP>`-w <VAR>100</VAR> -h <VAR>40</VAR>'</SAMP>
are specified. A 40 mm square with an additional left margin of
(100-40)/2 = 30 mm will be produced if option <SAMP>`-C'</SAMP> is given.
If the actual width/height ration of the picture exactly matches
the ratio defined by <SAMP>`-w -h'</SAMP>, option <SAMP>`-C'</SAMP> has no effect.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC7">Pen sizes and colors</A></H2>

<P>
Imagine a plotter with a pen carousel, e.g., like the model HP7550A.
The carousel carries a (small) number of pens. Their colors and tip
thicknesses (sizes) are selected by a human operator, while the plotter
only receives commands like "Now use pen number 5". If you don't provide a
pen, the plotter will move and "draw" without this pen if its number
is selected.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> emulates a carousel of up to 8 pens of various colors and sizes.
By default, all pens are present, have <VAR>foreground</VAR> color
(typically <VAR>black</VAR>), and their tip thicknesses are one unit
(here: 1/10 <CODE>mm</CODE> for vector modes, 1 pixel for raster modes).
HPGL/2 commands NP,PC,PW may override this for up to 255 freely configurable
pens.

</P>
<P>
Pen colors and sizes are represented by digits to allow for a compact
option list. There are 8 colors including <VAR>background</VAR> (usually white).
See section <A HREF="hp2xxinf.html#SEC30">Option summary</A> for a list of all colors. E.g., color 3 is green,
and color 7 means yellow. Permitted pen sizes are 0 ... 9 units.
WARNING: In raster modes, all pen sizes are approximated by double, triple,
etc. width, and lines wider than 4 will probably not give useful results.

</P>
<P>
Options <SAMP>`-c <VAR>c-string</VAR>'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-s <VAR>s-string</VAR>'</SAMP> tell
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> about the pens to be placed in the carousel.
<VAR>c-string</VAR> and <VAR>s-string</VAR> are strings of 1 to 8 digits,
corresponding to special choices of pen 1 to 8.
Defaults are <VAR>c-string</VAR> = <VAR>s-string</VAR> = <SAMP>`11111111'</SAMP> unless the
hpgl file contains corresponding PC and/or PW commands. Specifying <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> overrides the equivalent HPGL/2 command.
If you specify less than 8 pens, the remaining pens keep their defaults.

</P>
<P>
Examples:

<PRE>
hp2xx -p13 foo.hp
</PRE>

<P>
Show a preview of <SAMP>`foo.hp'</SAMP>, drawing all lines with pen #2 three
pixels wide instead of default 1 pixel, which applies to all other pens.

</P>

<PRE>
hp2xx -c12740 -p12230412 foo.hp
</PRE>

<P>
Here, pen #5 is "removed". Pens #1 and #7 keep their default sizes,
all others are set to various sizes.
Pen #2 is red, #3 is yellow, and #4 is blue, while all other
pens keep <SAMP>`foreground'</SAMP> color, e.g., black.

</P>
<P>
If your HP-GL file contains the PC and/or PW commands introduced with
HP-GL/2, these are interpreted to allow up to 255 pens. The special case
where a pen is redefined to take on different colors is currently only
supported in PostScript output mode. In all other modes, the last PC
command encountered determines that pens' color for the entire plot.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC8">Selecting a page</A></H2>

<P>
There is a HP-GL command named <SAMP>`PG;'</SAMP> which amounts to a FormFeed.
Thus, there are multi-page HP-GL sources. While <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> was
designed for just one output picture per input file, there is a
simple way to cope also with multi-page sources:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> keeps track of the number of encountered <SAMP>`PG;'</SAMP> commands.
All code up to the next (if any) <SAMP>`PG;'</SAMP> command is considered a
single page. Pages are counted, starting at 1. You can ask <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>
to ignore all HP-GL commands other than on page <VAR>n</VAR> with option
<SAMP>`-P <VAR>n</VAR>'</SAMP>, effectively filtering out any one-page graphics.
Sometimes, converting a whole page range makes sense, too. Therefore,
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> also accepts page ranges via <SAMP>`-P <VAR>n1</VAR>:<VAR>n2</VAR>'</SAMP>.
The default is <SAMP>`-P <VAR>0</VAR>'</SAMP> which selects all pages.

</P>
<P>
WARNING: Some HP-GL sources may start with a <SAMP>`PG;'</SAMP> so the first
page of your graphics may be 2 instead of 1. Look for the number of
encountered pages in the diagnostic output if you miss the expected page!
If the detected coordinate range shows unreasonable numbers like 1e10,
you'll be probably looking at an empty page.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC9">Vector formats</A></H2>

<P>
All HP-GL graphics are decomposed by <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> into elementary
move and draw commands. Selecting a vector mode essentially defines the
conversion rules of such commands into specific formats.

</P>
<P>
The most popular and versatile vector format currently is
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS). (In fact, it is much more than just a
vector graphics format, but <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> uses only EPS's line drawing
features.) Many programs allow importation of EPS files, and PostScript
gives excellent printing results, so <SAMP>`-m <CODE>eps</CODE>'</SAMP> is highly
recommended.

</P>
<P>
Unix users may also want to use either <CODE>Gnuplot</CODE> or especially <CODE>XFig</CODE>
to annotate their plots. The native formats of these programs are directly
supported via the <SAMP>`-m <CODE>gpt</CODE>'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-m <CODE>fig</CODE>'</SAMP> options.

</P>
<P>
Currently, all other supported vector formats represent various compromises
to persuade TeX or LaTeX into the generation of graphics.
See section <A HREF="hp2xxinf.html#SEC21">TeX  formats</A>, if you are specially interested in TeX.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC10">Raster formats</A></H2>

<P>
Raster graphics are probably the most widely used graphics by now.
Many publishing programs accept rasterized graphics. It's likely you'll
use <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> primarily in some raster mode.

</P>
<P>
In addition to vector modes, all raster modes need the desired resolution
of an assumed underlying pixel grid to plot on, i. e., the number of
pixels per unit length within that grid.
A traditional measure is the number of "dots per inch" (DPI).
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> makes an exception from its usual unit length <CODE>mm</CODE> and
lets you specify the traditional DPI values.
Option <SAMP>`-d <VAR>num</VAR>'</SAMP> affects both x and y direction, <VAR>num</VAR> being
the DPI value (an integer). if <SAMP>`-D <VAR>num_y</VAR>'</SAMP> is also specified,
<VAR>num_y</VAR> will override the <VAR>num</VAR> DPI value, but only for the y
direction.

</P>
<P>
There are plenty of raster formats on various platforms, much more
than <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> will ever handle. The supported raster formats
IMG, PBM/PPM, PCL, PCX, PNG and TIFF were chosen for their widespread use, their simplicity,
for actual demand, and for accessibility of specifications.
If your desired format is not supported, look for a converter. E.g., the
Portable Bitmap (PBM) project and more recently, the ImageMagick package 
offer quite a variety of such converters.

</P>
<P>
Please note that the preview mode (which does not create any output file)
is a special raster mode. Instead of going into some output file,
the internal bitmap is transferred into display memory.
Therefore, the above considerations apply also to preview mode.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC11">Printer formats</A></H2>

<P>
Currently, there is only one well-tested printer format (not counting <SAMP>`eps'</SAMP>, which
is printable on PostScript printers): <SAMP>`pcl'</SAMP>, which stands for HP PCL
Level 3. Essentially it is a raster format, but it comes with a few
restrictions and additional options which correspond to printer properties.
It prints on HP Laserjet and HP Deskjet series printers and compatibles.

</P>
<P>
The restriction concerns the resolution (DPI) during rasterization. Due to
printer hardware limitations, only <SAMP>`-d 75'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-d 100'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-d 150'</SAMP>,
and <SAMP>`-d 300'</SAMP> are recommended (<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> will emit a warning for other
values, but will try to create the desired output); option <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> must not 
be used. Some recent printer models do support 600, 720 or even higher
resolutions, but even for those the requirements both in terms of cpu load
and file size may be prohibitive.

</P>
<P>
There are two flags which may be useful if the output goes directly
to a printer: Option <SAMP>`-i'</SAMP> initializes the printer and tries to select
the required paper format before the output starts, and <SAMP>`-F'</SAMP> sends a 
FormFeed (ASCII 12) after the output.

</P>
<P>
For the HP Deskjet printer series, there is support of some "special"
commands; <SAMP>`-S 1'</SAMP> activates these. There is a limited support of color
modes available, too: For the DJ500C and newer models, <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> can
generate both CMY-based and CMYK-based color output (if colors are used:
see option <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>). Supply option <SAMP>`-S 3'</SAMP> for CMY color mode, and
option <SAMP>`-S 4'</SAMP> for CMYK color mode (for the DJ550C). The Deskjet modes
automatically invoke TIFF compression (mode 2), while pure PCL Level 3
does not know about compression.

</P>
<P>
A driver for the Esc/P2 raster language used by the Epson Stylus series
of inkjet printers has been added in <CODE>hp2xx-3.4.0</CODE>. This should work 
at least for the small-format printers at 720 dpi.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC12">Preview</A></H2>

<P>
Preview mode is <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>'s default. Its use prior to all other
conversions is recommended since it offers a good impression of your
final results. Functionally it is also a raster mode.

</P>
<P>
Depending on your hardware and operating system platform,
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> uses one of a variety of preview modules.
On GUIs, a window containing the graphics will pop up, while on other
systems the whole screen may be used for preview. You can control the
position of a preview window via options <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> in
a natural way. In full-screen previews, unused spaces are padded to the
right and bottom with background color.

</P>
<P>
Since there is no way for <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> to predict the actual size and
resolution of your preview device, e.g., screen, you may have to
gauge <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>'s preview mode (using options <SAMP>`-whdD'</SAMP>). For example,
if your device effectively works at 86 DPI and offers an active area of
24 by 18 cm,

<PRE>
hp2xx -d86 -w240 -h180 foo.hp
</PRE>

<P>
will make maximum use of your screen area and give you correct sizes.
Since a single gauge will do for all future calls, you'll probably want
to create some one-line batch file for invoking <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> in preview
mode, correctly gauged for your screen.

</P>

<P>
Depending on page offsets and the selected sizes and resolutions, a preview
may not fit on your screen. In that case, some preview modules simply
clip the picture; others give a warning but let you continue (DOS),
and others simply terminate -- so don't start too large.

</P>
<P>
DOS users: Most VGA cards offer high-resolution modes (SVGAs). Unfortunately,
there is no software standard for these modes. <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> lets you
utilize these modes anyway with just a little help from you.
Tell <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> the so-called mode byte of your favorite hi-res mode
via option <SAMP>`-V <VAR>num</VAR>'</SAMP>. Since <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> issues only standard
BIOS calls for mode switching, setting of color look-up table entries,
and pixel drawing, chances are good that your VGA card's hi-res modes
will work!

</P>
<P>
WARNING: You can damage your hardware by specifying inappropriate VGA modes!
Generally you'll need a monitor which can sync on the horizontal frequency
of the selected VGA hi-res mode, e.g., a multi-scan monitor. In case of
doubt, switch off your monitor immediately!!

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC13">Misc. options</A></H2>

<P>
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> features an on-line options summary. Invoking <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>
with option <SAMP>`-H'</SAMP>, or with any illegal option or without any
parameter, will display about 2 pages of text. (Note: I'd have preferred
option <SAMP>`-h'</SAMP> for on-line help, but this option is needed by the
indispensable <VAR>height</VAR> parameter.)

</P>
<P>
During operation, <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> outputs various information about the current
HP-GL file and about <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>'s actions. As usual, all this goes to
<CODE>stderr</CODE>. You can re-direct these diagnostics into a file even without
any help from a UNIX shell by specifying a log file using option
<SAMP>`-l <VAR>logfile</VAR>'</SAMP>, or you may switch off diagnostics completely
with option <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> (<SAMP>`quiet'</SAMP> mode). NOTE: Using both options
as in <SAMP>`-q -l <VAR>logfile</VAR>'</SAMP> is of no use as it will result in an
empty <VAR>logfile</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
Finally, there is a simple way to rotate whole pictures:
Option <SAMP>`-r <VAR>angle</VAR>'</SAMP> rotates the picture counter-clockwise by
the supplied angle (given in degrees). E.g.,

<PRE>
hp2xx -r90 foo.hp
</PRE>

<P>
will show the picture rotated by 90 degrees, letting vectors originally
pointing left-to-right now point botttom-to-top. This may be handy e.g. for
printing in landscape format.
NOTE: The limiting rectangle supplied by <SAMP>`-hw'</SAMP> is not affected by
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>, so in order to obtain e.g. a full-page landscape picture on an

<H2><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC15">The coordinate range</A></H2>

<P>
The natural unit of length in HP-GL is 1/40 mm = 0.025 mm, so a typical
A4 page covers roughly 11000 x 7500 natural units. Typically, coordinates in
HP-GL commands will be found in the range 0 ... 12000. <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> will tell
you the maximum and minimum coordinates ("picture limits")
it finds in your HP-GL picture for both x and y direction.
These values usually roughly cover this range.
Even if your HP-GL source plots in user-specific coordinates (realized
via HP-GL command <SAMP>`SC;'</SAMP> (SCale) ), this remains true, since
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> internally transforms all points back to natural coordinates.
Whenever the above range is grossly violated, you may suspect corrupted
data, because no real plotter would be able to plot such a file.

</P>
<P>
If you ever discover a picture limit equalling plus or minus 10^10,
your HP-GL probably didn't draw anything. Initially, <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>'s internal
picture limits are set to impossibly large (or small) values, i. e., +- 10^10,
but the first plot command will set them to values found therein, and successive
plots push the limits outward. Example: <VAR>xmax</VAR> starts at -10^10,
the first plot command may change it to 2536, the next to 3470, the next
20 command fall short, etc. Eventually, <VAR>xmax</VAR> assumes the largest
value and stays there. Knowledge about these details may sometimes
be crucial (see section <A HREF="hp2xxinf.html#SEC17">Scaling to true size</A>).

</P>
<P>
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> uses the picture limits internally for scaling and fitting the
data into the supplied  limiting rectangle (see section <A HREF="hp2xxinf.html#SEC6">Sizing your output</A>).
You can also affect the picture limits yourself for special effects
(see section <A HREF="hp2xxinf.html#SEC16">Fixed scaling</A>).

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC16">Fixed scaling</A></H2>

<P>
As noted earlier, <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> does not draw to scale, but rather it fits
a picture into a given limiting window. While this is very handy in most
applications, it may be undesirable when a series of pictures must be drawn
to the same scale. Unless all pictures possess the same picture limits
(modulo offsets), e.g., because all of them are surrounded by some fixed
frame, <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> would scale them all up differently to fit each of them
tightly into the limiting window.

</P>
<P>
There are two simple cures: First, make use of the true size option <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP>.
If the original HP-GL sizes do not fit, adjust picture limits to
guarantee a constant scaling: Make a preview of all pictures and note
the coordinate ranges <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> reports. Then, determine picture limits
which cover all of these individual limits. Finally, run <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>
to create your desired outputs using options <SAMP>`-xXyY'</SAMP> to tell
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> about the picture limits it should use. If the pictures
do not share common offsets, you may have to correct for offsets
manually. Use the preview mode for testing. You'll get the same scale
as long as the limiting window and (<VAR>xmax</VAR> - <VAR>xmin</VAR>) and
(<VAR>ymax</VAR> - <VAR>ymin</VAR>) remain constant for all pictures.

</P>
<P>
WARNING: <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> does not clip lines. If the picture limits which
you manually can pre-set via options <SAMP>`-xXyY'</SAMP> are chosen too narrow,
they will be pushed outside just as described in the last section,
resulting in a different scale. Check the coordinate ranges <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>
reports. The should match the values supplied by options <SAMP>`-xXyY'</SAMP>!

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC17">Scaling to true size</A></H2>

<P>
Earlier releases of <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> (binaries) did not offer option
<SAMP>`-t'</SAMP>, which does everything you'll need for producing output with
exactly the sizes shown on a real plotter. The following paragraph
shows how to manually emulate the working of this option. Though outdated,
I left it in the manual as background material:

</P>
<P>
Sometimes you might want to create pictures sized exactly as if they
were drawn on a real plotter. There is a little trick which allows
you to do so using <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>: As notes above, the natural unit of
length in HP-GL is 0.025 mm. Therefore, you can calculate the true
picture size from the picture limits reported by <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>. Transform
these data into mm and simply specify the limiting window accordingly!
Example:
<SAMP>`hp2xx truesize.hp'</SAMP> reports the following coordinate ranges:
<VAR>xmin</VAR> = 250, <VAR>xmax</VAR> = 5250, <VAR>ymin</VAR> = 100, <VAR>ymax</VAR> = 3100.
Thus, the picture is (<VAR>xmax</VAR> - <VAR>xmin</VAR>) * 0.025 mm = 125 mm wide
and <VAR>ymax</VAR> - <VAR>ymin</VAR>) * 0.025 mm = 75 mm high, and
<SAMP>`hp2xx -w125 -h75 truesize.hp'</SAMP> will draw it in true size.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC18">Swapping</A></H2>

<P>
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> allocates memory for an internal bitmap dynamically.
Large pictures, high resolution, and use of colors may combine to
let your computer run out of memory (especially on non-swapping operating
systems like DOS).

</P>
<P>
In this case, <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> swaps the bitmap to disk, slowing down
considerably. Redirecting swapping to a fast disk, preferably a RAM disk,
might speed up things. You can replace the default swap file
<TT>`hp2xx.swp'</TT> using <SAMP>`-s <TT>`swapfile'</TT>'</SAMP>.
NOTE: If for some reason <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> is aborted during swapping, you might
have to delete the swap file manually.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC19">Dots and lines</A></H2>

<P>
Here are some basics about the generation of dots and lines within
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE>. I mention them, because there is something left to be
improved here...

</P>
<P>
Some HP-GL codes cause <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> to generate points rather than lines
of length zero. There is a subtle difference between both. Depending
on the current output format, special code for points will be generated,
and occasionally, a point will look different from a zero-length line.
Use <SAMP>`-m epic'</SAMP> for such an example.

</P>
<P>
Line thicknesses can vary. Especially for thick lines, the matter of
line caps (how lines are ended, e.g. with a round cap) becomes relevant.
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> does not do an elaborate job here. If line caps matter to you,
use <SAMP>`-m eps'</SAMP>, edit the resulting Encapsulated PostScript file, look
for a line with <CODE>setlinecap</CODE> in it (near line 45), and select the
line cap of your choice by modifying the PostScript command <CODE>setlinecap</CODE>
accordingly. You can also use Metafont (via <SAMP>`-m mf'</SAMP>) and replace
the picked pen "pencircle" by some other type. However, both methods
are far from convenient.

</P>
<P>
The internal rasterization done by <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> is a simple process
and may someday be replaced by something more efficient: A "draw point"
command essentially sets a single pel in the internal buffer.
If line width grows (2 - 4 units), a square of 2 to 4 pels length will
be set. Vector drawing is broken down to point drawing by the
Bresenham algorithm. Therefore, there is no notion of controlled
line caps. The shapes of line ends simply result from plotting these squares.
In addition, plotting all those pels is not really efficiently implemented,
so if anybody out there looks for a good place for speeding up <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>,
this code (located in file <TT>`picbuf.c'</TT>) is a good place to start.

</P>
<P>
Currently there are no plans by me to introduce different line caps
into <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>, so waiting for them will be of no use.

</P>

<H2><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC21">TeX  formats</A></H2>

<P>
TeX  was designed for typesetting, not for handling graphics. Putting
graphics directly into TeX  therefore is always somewhat clumsy.
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> offers four different compromises to do that, and much
better, though more indirect ways.

</P>
<P>
<SAMP>`-m <CODE>mf</CODE>'</SAMP> generates Metafont source code. Run <CODE>Metafont</CODE>
and <CODE>gftopk</CODE>, and you'll end up with a special <CODE>pk</CODE> font
containing the single letter Z which represents your picture. Placing
this Z somewhere in your document using standard TeX  commands
draws your picture there.

</P>
<P>
If you want to avoid fiddling with additional programs and fonts, if you
work with LaTeX, and if you do not need high-quality plots,
the macros within <CODE>epic.sty</CODE> may help you.
<SAMP>`-m <CODE>tex</CODE>'</SAMP> causes <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> to generate
appropriate TeX source code which you can <SAMP>`\input{}'</SAMP> into
LaTeX sources.

</P>
<P>
For emTeX users, there are yet another two way: <SAMP>`-m <CODE>em</CODE>'</SAMP>
creates TeX code containing many commands like <SAMP>`\special{em:...}'</SAMP>
for line drawing. The line drawing task will therefore be handled not by
TeX itself but by the emTeX drivers which can handle arbitrary
line slopes etc. Similarly, <SAMP>`-m <CODE>cad</CODE>'</SAMP> produces code based on
the same principle, but compatible with program <TT>`TeXcad.exe'</TT>, which is
distributed as a part of emTeX, and which offers editing and drawing
features for the desired HP-GL figure(s).

</P>
<P>
Please note that all methods for generation of graphics <VAR>within</VAR>
TeX are compromises which usually work only for simple graphics.
You'll probably prefer using external methods like including EPS vector
graphics files with Tom Rokicki's <CODE>dvips</CODE> driver, or PCX files via the
emTeX drivers, or you'll generate special fonts with convenient
programs like F. Sowa's <CODE>bm2font</CODE>. <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> can help you in all
of these cases. The following table shows the pros and cons of the
various approaches (all are based on PD software):

</P>

<PRE>
Internal methods (all allowing DVI previewing of graphs):

via Metafont
  <CODE>+:</CODE> Machine-independent; fully compatible with TeX
  <CODE>-:</CODE> Slow; capacity problems with Metafont / gftopk / some DVI drivers
            if used with large and/or complex graphics

via <CODE>epic.sty</CODE>
  <CODE>+:</CODE> Machine-independent; single-step, native LaTeX approach; PD software
  <CODE>-:</CODE> Slow; requires LaTeX; low-quality lines; just one line thickness;
            complex graphs may exceed TeX capacity

via emTeX's <CODE>\special{em:...}</CODE>
  <CODE>+:</CODE> No TeX capacity problem; good line quality; single-step procedure;
            rasterization on demand, giving optimal resolution
  <CODE>-:</CODE> Slows down drivers; driver capacity may be exceeded; emTeX required

External methods:

via PCX file inclusion:
  <CODE>+:</CODE> Easy and fast; DVI preview of graphics
  <CODE>-:</CODE> Requires emTeX drivers (only available on DOS and OS/2)

via special fonts:
  <CODE>+:</CODE> Easy, fast, and trouble-free font generation via <CODE>bm2font</CODE>;
            DVI preview of graphics (!); portable
  <CODE>-:</CODE> Many files for fonts etc.; confusing for novices

via EPS:
  <CODE>+:</CODE> High-quality results; easy; no burden for TeX or drivers
  <CODE>-:</CODE> No DVI preview; PostScript printer (or, e.g., GhostScript) required;
            PostScript previewing is slower than DVI previewing.

<H1><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC22">Installation and modification notes</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC23">Installation procedure</A></H2>

<P>
Please note: The following description is very brief and assumes that you
are familiar with installation of PD software in general.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC24">Installing an executable version</A></H3>

<P>
This is simple! If you find a collection of pre-compiled versions of
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE>, obtain the file <TT>`read.me'</TT> and read it to find out the
name of the file which fits to your system. Obtain it, rename it to something
like <TT>`hp2xx'</TT> or <TT>`hp2xx.exe'</TT>, and place it somewhere on your
search path -- that's it.

</P>
<P>
However, since the source release of <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> under the GNU public
license, the usual mode of installation has become configuring and 
building <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> on your own system. This is detailed in the next section. 

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC25">Source-level installation</A></H3>

<P>
NOTE: I am tempted to switch to GNU autoconf , i.e. have a configure
script generate the necessary Makefile automagically. This will probably
not be welcomed by those not on Unix-like platforms, however.
Currently, installation depends too much
on manual work yet. Here is a description how to proceed:

</P>
<P>
After unbundling all sources, go to subdirectory <TT>`./makes'</TT>. Select a
makefile most closely resembling your system's needs from the samples given,
copy it to <TT>`./sources/makefile'</TT>, adapt it manually (if necessary),
and run <CODE>make all</CODE>.
If everything is set correctly, this results directly in a valid executable
file which you may install at any convenient place on your search path.

</P>
<P>
There are two types of makefile adaptation: First, let's assume there
is a makefile template available for your system. You then have the option to
add a few unsupported modes. Do so by un-commenting the appropriate lines
near the beginning of the makefile, and by commenting out the corresponding
standard lines.

</P>
<P>
The second type of course applies to systems with special needs which are not
yet covered by any makefile template. Currently, you are on your own when
it comes to supplying alternate paths, renaming or adding system libraries
and alike. Most probably you might have to tell the makefile where to
look for the X11 stuff, and where to find the png library, if at all.

</P>
<P>
Note: Don't feel alarmed if your makefile seems to neglect many source files.
Any single installation will make use of only one previewer (two on
SUNs with activated SunView support), and there are platform-dependent
sources for some output formats which are not always used.

</P>
<P>
Users wishing to compile <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> on MS Windows systems will find a
step-by-step procedure in the file <TT>`hp2xx_nt'</TT> in the documentation directory.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC26">Adding your own formats</A></H2>

<P>
First, study section <A HREF="hp2xxinf.html#SEC1">Introduction</A> for the outline of the modular structure and
general operation of <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Let's assume you want to support TIFF format. The probably easiest way
of adding new formats is by modifying copies of existing files. Since TIFF
is a raster format, a good starting point would be <TT>`to_pcx.c'</TT>.
(Files <TT>`to_mf.c'</TT> or <TT>`to_eps.c'</TT> should be considered in case
of a vector format, and <TT>`to_vga.c'</TT> or <TT>`to_x11.c'</TT> in case of
a new previewer.) Copy it to a file <TT>`to_tiff.c'</TT> and edit the latter.
The old code is pretty much self-explanatory. Essentially, the output file
is opened, initializations are performed, and the internal bitmap is
converted into the target format (here, TIFF) scanline-by-scanline.
There is just one routine called from other modules (originally named
<CODE>PicBuf_to_PCX</CODE>. Rename it to e.g. <CODE>PicBuf_to_TIFF</CODE> ) and adapt
the conversion code.

</P>
<P>
Once you've done that, the rest (integration of the new format into the
package) is easy: First, edit <TT>`hp2xx.h'</TT> and add a prototype
line for <CODE>PicBuf_to_TIFF</CODE> in analogy to e.g., <CODE>PicBuf_to_PCX</CODE>.
Edit the <TT>`makefile'</TT>s and add <CODE>to_tiff.c</CODE> to the list of sources
and e.g. <CODE>to_tiff.o</CODE> to the list of objects. Now you are ready for
compilation tests (but not for linking yet).

</P>
<P>
Then, change the main file <TT>`hp2xx.c'</TT> at various places: Near the
beginning of the file, add <TT>`XX_TIFF, '</TT> to the <CODE>hp2xx_mode</CODE> typedef,
and a line like <TT>`XX_TIFF,   "tiff", '</TT> to the <CODE>ModeList</CODE> struct below.
Please note the alphabetical order of these lists. Never put anything behind
the termination code <CODE>XX_TERM</CODE>! At the end of the file,
add a <CODE>case</CODE> statement to the <CODE>switch</CODE> list in analogy to e.g.
the <CODE>PCX</CODE> entry.

</P>
<P>
You may also want to add a line to the on-line help to
announce the new format, and change the release number and date.
Look for functions <CODE>Send_ID</CODE> and <CODE>usage_msg</CODE> at the first quarter
of file <TT>`hp2xx.c'</TT>!

</P>
<P>
Now a <CODE>make all</CODE> will produce code containing the new format.
If your format turns out to work nicely and seems to be of general interest,
please consider contributing it to the <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> project.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC27">Future improvements</A></H2>

<P>
The following table lists miscellaneous desirable features for future
releases:

<PRE>
  Box and sector drawing / filling
  Other, more rarely used HP-GL commands
  Color support in UIS 
  PCL: Better data compression for DJ500, DJ500C, DJ550;
  Loadable fonts, e.g. Hershey fonts, or: more built-in fonts
  Full-screen previewer for OS/2
  Easy installation on various platforms, e.g. via a configure script
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC28">Font coding</A></H2>

<P>
This section is intended for those few users who might care to
improve the built-in character set of <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
HP-GL plotters feature built-in fonts with both fixed and
variable-width characters. There are commands for font selection
and quick switching between two pre-selected fonts, and there
is also a way for users to download own character definitions.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> currently features just a few fixed-width  character sets 
(sets 0-7).

</P>
<P>
If you plan to modify these characters set or to add more,
you need an understanding of how characters are drawn by
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE>. The source file <TT>`charset.h'</TT> contains a comment
explaining this procedure. Below you find a (modified) copy of
this:

</P>

<PRE>
 This file defines a standard character set by elementary
 "draw" &#38; "move" commands. The format is a very compact one from
 the old days where every byte was still appreciated.

 A font or character set is an array of strings. Each character is
 addressed by its ASCII code.

 A character is a (NULL-terminated) string of bytes. Each byte
 codes for a draw or move action according to the code below:

     <CODE>Bit: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0</CODE>
     <CODE>     p x x x y y y y</CODE>

 <CODE>p:   </CODE> Plot flag. If set, "draw to" new point, else "move to" it.
 <CODE>xxx: </CODE> 3-bit unsigned integer  (0...7). X coordinate of new point.
 <CODE>yyyy:</CODE> 4-bit unsigned integer (0..15). Y coordinate of new point.

 The baseline is y = 4 instead of y = 0, so characters with parts
 below it can be drawn properly. Function "code_to_ucoord" transforms
 these coordinates into actual user coordinates.

 Example:  code for character <CODE>'L': "\032\224\324"</CODE> translates to:
           <CODE>moveto(1,10); drawto(1,4); drawto(5,4);</CODE>

 From the example you can conclude that the font below essentially is
 defined on a 5x7 grid:

     <CODE>    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7</CODE>
     <CODE>15  - - - - - - - -     - : unused</CODE>
     <CODE>14  - - - - - - - -     # : always used</CODE>
     <CODE>13  - - - - - - - -     o : sometimes used</CODE>
     <CODE>12  - - - - - - - -</CODE>
     <CODE>11  - - - - - - - -</CODE>
     <CODE>10  o # # # # # - -</CODE>
     <CODE> 9  o # # # # # - -</CODE>
     <CODE> 8  o # # # # # - -</CODE>
     <CODE> 7  o # # # # # - -</CODE>
     <CODE> 6  o # # # # # - -</CODE>
     <CODE> 5  o # # # # # - -</CODE>
     <CODE> 4  o # # # # # - -</CODE>
     <CODE> 3  o o o o o o - -</CODE>
     <CODE> 2  o o o o o o - -</CODE>
     <CODE> 1  o o o o o o - -</CODE>
     <CODE> 0  o o o o o o - -</CODE>
</PRE>



<H1><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC29">Known HP-GL commands</A></H1>

<P>
<CODE>hp2xx</CODE> originally emulated a subset of the Hewlett-Packard 7550A plotter.
The following manual was used as reference for command definitions:
<CITE>[1] HP 7550A Interfacing and Programming Manual</CITE>. This has gradually
been expanded to include allmost all of what is now known as HPGL/1, and
most of the commands from HPGL/2.

</P>
<P>
Not all commands are supported. Among the non-supported commands
are those which do not really apply to a software emulator, like:

</P>

<PRE>
commands affecting the communication between plotter and host computer,
commands for changing the behaviour of a real plotter, like plotting speed etc.,
commands for the control of plotter memory allocation,
commands causing various plotter display outputs.
</PRE>

<P>
Other non-supported commands would be desirable, but were left out
due to their inherent complexity (or just because nobody had an immediate
need for them yet).

</P>
<P>
Programmers intending to add more HP-GL features should ideally take care to
implement the less-than-obvious side effects of existing commands on
the new features, too (and vice versa). E. g., line types (<CODE>LT;</CODE>)
affect most but not all drawing commands: While the <CODE>ER;</CODE> command
(edge rectangle relative) uses the current line type, its counterpart
<CODE>EA;</CODE> (edge rectangle absolute) always draws solid lines. However,
both <CODE>PR;</CODE> and <CODE>PA;</CODE> use the current line type! In addition,
new features may need initializations by the already supported
codes <CODE>IN;</CODE> or <CODE>DF;</CODE>, so these may have to be expanded.
So carefully consult [1] prior to adding new HP-GL commands.

</P>
<P>
The remainder of this section lists all HP-GL commands given on
pages 1-2 to 1-4 of [1] and marks them as either

</P>

<PRE>
      <CODE>(.)</CODE>  not applicable,
      <CODE>(-)</CODE>  ignored, or
      <CODE>(+)</CODE>  supported.
</PRE>

<P>
The label "supported" is used when I think the command is fully supported
in the context of the already implemented commands. In general,
you should have absolutely no problem with this class of commands.

</P>
<P>
Though there still are unsupported commands, this does not mean that
you might have trouble using <CODE>hp2xx</CODE>. Nowadays, most HP-GL files are
machine-generated, e.g. by CAD or DTP programs. These tend to make use
of just a simple subset of HP-GL. To my experience, chances are high
that <CODE>hp2xx</CODE> will give you the picture you want!

<H1><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="hp2xxinf_toc.html#TOC30">Option summary</A></H1>

<P>
In the following, options are grouped into subjects and
are listed alphabetically within each subject. Both long options and
short (one-letter) options are listed, where short options appear in
parentheses. Except for the +DPI option, there is a one-to-one correspondence
between long and short options. You may use either long or short options.
Mixing long and short options is acceptable.

</P>
<P>
Option parameter names suggest the expected data type, e. g.,
<SAMP>`--rotate (-r) <VAR>float</VAR>'</SAMP> means that option <SAMP>`--rotate'</SAMP> or its
corresponding short form <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> expect a parameter of type <SAMP>`float'</SAMP>.
